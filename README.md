# Credit Card Fraud Detection Project

## Description
This project implements a machine learning pipeline to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using a Random Forest classifier. The process includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training with imbalance handling (SMOTE), evaluation, and prediction on new data.

## Dataset
- **Raw Data:** The original `fraudTrain.csv` dataset used for this project is not included in the repository due to its size. It can be downloaded from Kaggle:
  [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection/code)
- **Cleaned Data:** The cleaned data (`fraud_Train_cleaned_.csv`) is generated by `1_Preprocessing.ipynb` but may be excluded from the repo if too large. If excluded, run `1_Preprocessing.ipynb` first.

## Setup
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Install the required libraries (see `requirements.txt` if added, otherwise install manually): `pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn imbalanced-learn`
3. Download `fraudTrain.csv` from the link above and place it in the main project directory.

## Workflow / Usage
The project is structured in a modular way using Jupyter notebooks:

1.  **`1_Preprocessing.ipynb`**: Loads raw data, performs cleaning/feature engineering, saves `fraud_Train_cleaned_.csv`. *(Run this first if cleaned data is not in the repo)*.
2.  **`2_Model_Training.ipynb`**: Loads cleaned data, splits/scales/applies SMOTE, trains models, evaluates, saves `.pkl` files (`rf_model.pkl`, `scaler.pkl`, `model_features.pkl`).
3.  **`3_Prediction.ipynb`**: Loads `.pkl` files, loads *raw* data, applies preprocessing, predicts fraud using the saved model, displays alerts.

## Model Results
The final model selected is **Random Forest**. Key performance metrics achieved on the unseen test set are:

- **Recall (Fraud Class '1'):0.7955**
- **AUC-ROC:0.9757**

*(Refer to `2_Model_Training.ipynb` for the full evaluation).*
